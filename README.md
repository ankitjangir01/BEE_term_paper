\section{Abstract}
\section{Introduction}
    AR refers to \emph{Augmented Reality} which is a hot topic in technology and science field in present. Augmented reality is a technology that is powered by computer vision based logic and algorithms to augment audio, video, graphics and other sensor sensible inputs on real world objects. Basically it helps to make interaction better by virtually rendering objects and information on the real world in an interactive manner. It superimpose the real world view and technically added elements and finally produces coupled form of real world and virtual world to the user.
    \\
    VR stands for \emph{Virtual Reality}. It is a technology which allows us to create and experience computer generated world which can be simulation of real world or can be totally imaginary. We can create whatever environment we want and experience it in highly interactive fashion. VR could range from crating a small video game to travel through the space, go to the alien spaceship, play with animals in the ocean.

\section{AR and VR}    
\subsection{Difference in AR and VR}
    AR and VR technologies are similar in many aspects of mechanism, technology, concept and quite different yet. These are major differences between AR and VR-
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AR is augmented and backed from real world and need of real world setting is there and in case of VR, everything is virtual and imaginary.
        \item AR users can control themselves in a better and convenient way namely their position, location, movements etc. while VR users are controlled by the computer or system.
        \item VR requires dedicated setup to be worked viz VR headset and on the other hand AR can be accessed even with our smartphone.
        \item AR makes enhancements in terms of visuals and sound in both the virtual and real world and the VR works only for virtual world.
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip
    
\subsection{Market overview}
    These new emerging technologies are producing endless opportunities for business development and hence producing employment also. According to various financial agencies reports by 2022, the AR and VR market is projected to touch the 209.2 billion USD market. These technologies are currently moving industries through software and hardware development, visuals, audio, graphics, research and more. We can observe from the market that virtual and augmented reality become more entwined in how we process works, how we play, how we learn and think, making the attention this side we can state that this industry will continue growing in long future.
