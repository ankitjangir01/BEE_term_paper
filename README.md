\section{Abstract}
\section{Introduction}
    AR refers to \emph{Augmented Reality} which is a hot topic in technology and science field in present. Augmented reality is a technology that is powered by computer vision based logic and algorithms to augment audio, video, graphics and other sensor sensible inputs on real world objects. Basically it helps to make interaction better by virtually rendering objects and information on the real world in an interactive manner. It superimpose the real world view and technically added elements and finally produces coupled form of real world and virtual world to the user.
    \\
    VR stands for \emph{Virtual Reality}. It is a technology which allows us to create and experience computer generated world which can be simulation of real world or can be totally imaginary. We can create whatever environment we want and experience it in highly interactive fashion. VR could range from crating a small video game to travel through the space, go to the alien spaceship, play with animals in the ocean.

\section{AR and VR}    
\subsection{Difference in AR and VR}
    AR and VR technologies are similar in many aspects of mechanism, technology, concept and quite different yet. These are major differences between AR and VR-
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AR is augmented and backed from real world and need of real world setting is there and in case of VR, everything is virtual and imaginary.
        \item AR users can control themselves in a better and convenient way namely their position, location, movements etc. while VR users are controlled by the computer or system.
        \item VR requires dedicated setup to be worked viz VR headset and on the other hand AR can be accessed even with our smartphone.
        \item AR makes enhancements in terms of visuals and sound in both the virtual and real world and the VR works only for virtual world.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Market overview}
    These new emerging technologies are producing endless opportunities for business development and hence producing employment also. According to various financial agencies reports by 2022, the AR and VR market is projected to touch the 209.2 billion USD market. These technologies are currently moving industries through software and hardware development, visuals, audio, graphics, research and more. We can observe from the market that virtual and augmented reality become more entwined in how we process works, how we play, how we learn and think, making the attention this side we can state that this industry will continue growing in long future.

\subsection{Present examples of AR and VR}
    Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are new technologies which are growing and developing day by day. In the present time, many examples of mobile applications are there which are using these technologies today. Some of them are as following-
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Rec Room}- Rec Room is a massively popular virtual reality experience with millions of users. You can play it on iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Oculus, and Steam, among other devices. In user-created rooms, you can chat and hang out with millions of people, or you can create something new. Customizable avatars, tough games, and more are all available.
        \item \textbf{Cartoon Village}- Cartoon Village transports you to a vibrant mediaeval cartoon hamlet where you are free to explore every nook and cranny. The high degree of detail gives the rural enclave a truly lived-in feel, and you can easily modify the season and time of day to see how it impacts the residents' behaviours and the natural world around them. On devices running Android 4.2 or higher, it can also operate in Daydream mode. In the field of virtual reality, Cartoon Village has already established itself as the cutest CG-rendered app.
        \item \textbf{Via Jaunt VR}- The next immersive horror short from Jaunt is not for the faint of heart. Furthermore, it includes an interactive sound field combined in Dolby Atmos to truly frighten you. You've been given fair warning.
        \\
        Apart from these small applications, many growing startups are also in the market. Some major of them are introduced in the following section.

\subsection{Augmented and Virtual Reality Startups}
    Augmented and Virtual Reality industry is booming and thus making its large space in the startups. From construction to shopping, content creation to entertainment, these startups are changing the way how we shop, entertain ourselves and how businesses conduct meets and discuss strategies. Here is the list of such startups-
    \\
    \\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Vicarious Surgical} \\ \\
        Vicarious Surgical is solving one of the holy grails of virtual reality tech. This is allowing robots to make surgeries precisely and with highest success rate possible by powering them with accurate movements. The main trick is that a doctor with expertise of a specific surgery can still do it even when he is miles away, with the help of VR headset. By combining doctors knowledge with cutting edge technology, Vicarious Surgical provides access to affordable yet effective medical options to the patients. Microsoft founder Bill Gates also invested in the same.

        \item \textbf{Holoride} \\ \\
        The goal of Holoride is to make ordinary car rides into virtual theme parks. The experience is both physical and visceral, thanks to the combination of regular navigational data with automobile data and virtual reality technologies. Car sickness is also not an issue. The experience is a smooth virtual reality adventure with little to no delay between what a user sees and feels, providing an intriguing alternative to reading a book or viewing a movie on a lengthy vehicle ride or travel.
